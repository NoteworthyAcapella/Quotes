/*
I see you've found the source code for the Noteworthy quotes page. Good for you, I guess. 
This parses the quotes found at https://www.noteworthylhs.ml/Quotes/Data.json
As new people join, add them to the array on line 2 of that file.
New quotes should have the following format:

  {
    "quoteBy":[name of person quoted, matching their name in the array],[endline character optional]
    "content":[the quote]
    "nsfw":[boolean value, true if an NSFW quote that shouldn't be on easy-to-find page.]
  },

Feel free to make edits to this code. If something breaks, I will keep a copy of a working version of this page. However, I recommend
If something breaks, contact 312wls@gmail.com and I can send you the original file.
PLEASE DO NOT DELETE OLD QUOTES!!! If people join who share the same name, I can help code something to differentiate between them.
